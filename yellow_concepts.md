Key Terms & Mental Models
In this guide, you will learn the essential vocabulary and mental models for understanding Yellow Network and state channel technology.

Goal: Build a solid conceptual foundation before diving into implementation.

Core Mental Model: Off-Chain Execution
The fundamental insight behind Yellow Network is simple:

Most interactions don't need immediate on-chain settlement.

Think of it like a bar tab:

Traditional (L1)	State Channels
Pay for each drink separately	Open a tab, pay once at the end
Wait for bartender each time	Instant service, settle later
Transaction per item	One transaction for the whole session
State channels apply this pattern to blockchain: lock funds once, transact off-chain, settle once.

Essential Vocabulary
State Channel
A state channel is a secure pathway for exchanging cryptographically signed states between participants without touching the blockchain.

Key properties:

Funds are locked in a smart contract
Participants exchange signed state updates off-chain
Only opening and closing require on-chain transactions
Either party can force on-chain settlement if needed
Analogy: Like a private Venmo between two parties, backed by a bank escrow.

Channel
A Channel is the on-chain representation of a state channel. It defines:

{
  participants: ['0xAlice', '0xBob'],   // Who can participate
  adjudicator: '0xContract',            // Rules for state validation
  challenge: 86400,                     // Dispute window (seconds)
  nonce: 1699123456789                  // Unique identifier
}

The channelId is computed deterministically from these parameters:

channelId = keccak256(participants, adjudicator, challenge, nonce, chainId)

State
A State is a snapshot of the channel at a specific moment:

{
  intent: 'OPERATE',           // Purpose: INITIALIZE, OPERATE, RESIZE, FINALIZE
  version: 5,                  // Incremental counter (higher = newer)
  data: '0x...',               // Application-specific data
  allocations: [...],          // How funds are distributed
  sigs: ['0xSig1', '0xSig2']   // Participant signatures
}

Key rule: A higher version number always supersedes a lower one, regardless of allocations.

Allocation
An Allocation specifies how funds should be distributed:

{
  destination: '0xAlice',              // Recipient address
  token: '0xUSDC_CONTRACT',            // Token contract
  amount: 50000000n                    // Amount in smallest unit (6 decimals for USDC)
}

The sum of allocations represents the total funds in the channel.

Clearnode
A Clearnode is the off-chain service that:

Manages the Nitro RPC protocol for state channel operations
Provides unified balance aggregated across multiple chains
Coordinates channels between users
Hosts app sessions for multi-party applications
Think of it as: A game server that acts as your entry point to Yellow Network—centralized for speed, but trustless because of on-chain guarantees.

Unified Balance
Your unified balance is the aggregation of funds across all chains where you have deposits:

Polygon: 50 USDC  ┐
Base:    30 USDC  ├─→ Unified Balance: 100 USDC
Arbitrum: 20 USDC ┘

You can:

Transfer from unified balance instantly (off-chain)
Withdraw to any supported chain
Lock funds into app sessions
App Session
An App Session is an off-chain channel built on top of the unified balance for multi-party applications:

{
  protocol: 'NitroRPC/0.4',
  participants: ['0xAlice', '0xBob', '0xJudge'],
  weights: [40, 40, 50],         // Voting power
  quorum: 80,                    // Required weight for state updates
  challenge: 3600,               // Dispute window
  nonce: 1699123456789
}

Use cases: Games, prediction markets, escrow, any multi-party coordination.

Session Key
A session key is a temporary cryptographic key that:

Is generated locally on your device
Has limited permissions and spending caps
Expires after a specified time
Allows gasless signing without wallet prompts
Flow:

Generate session keypair locally
Main wallet authorizes the session key (one-time EIP-712 signature)
All subsequent operations use the session key
Session expires or can be revoked
Protocol Components
Nitrolite
Nitrolite is the on-chain smart contract protocol:

Defines channel data structures
Implements create, close, challenge, resize operations
Provides cryptographic verification
Currently version 0.5.0
Nitro RPC
Nitro RPC is the off-chain communication protocol:

Compact JSON array format for efficiency
Every message is cryptographically signed
Bidirectional real-time communication
Currently version 0.4
Message format:

[requestId, method, params, timestamp]

// Example
[42, "transfer", {"destination": "0x...", "amount": "50.0"}, 1699123456789]

Custody Contract
The Custody Contract is the main on-chain entry point:

Locks and unlocks participant funds
Tracks channel status (VOID → ACTIVE → FINAL)
Validates signatures and state transitions
Handles dispute resolution
Adjudicator
An Adjudicator defines rules for valid state transitions:

Type	Rule
SimpleConsensus	Both participants must sign (default)
Remittance	Only sender must sign
Custom	Application-specific logic
State Lifecycle
Channel States
Channel doesn't exist

create()

Off-chain updates

challenge()

close()

checkpoint()

Timeout

Deleted

VOID

ACTIVE

DISPUTE

FINAL

Status	Meaning
VOID	Channel doesn't exist on-chain
INITIAL	Created, waiting for all participants (legacy)
ACTIVE	Fully operational, off-chain updates happening
DISPUTE	Challenge period active, parties can submit newer states
FINAL	Closed, funds distributed, metadata deleted
State Intents
Intent	When Used	Purpose
INITIALIZE	create()	First state when opening channel
OPERATE	Off-chain updates	Normal operation, redistribution
RESIZE	resize()	Add or remove funds
FINALIZE	close()	Final state for cooperative closure
Security Concepts
Challenge Period
When a dispute arises:

Party A submits their latest state via challenge()
Challenge period starts (typically 24 hours)
Party B can submit a newer valid state via checkpoint()
If no newer state, Party A's state becomes final after timeout
Purpose: Gives honest parties time to respond to incorrect claims.

Signatures
Two contexts for signatures:

Context	Hash Method	Signed By
On-chain	Raw packedState (no prefix)	Main wallet
Off-chain RPC	JSON payload hash	Session key
On-chain packedState:

keccak256(abi.encode(channelId, intent, version, data, allocations))

Quorum
For app sessions, quorum defines the minimum voting weight required for state updates:

Participants: [Alice, Bob, Judge]
Weights:      [40,    40,   50]
Quorum: 80

Valid combinations:
- Alice + Bob = 80 ✓
- Alice + Judge = 90 ✓
- Bob + Judge = 90 ✓
- Alice alone = 40 ✗
